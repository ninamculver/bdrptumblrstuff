For people to follow and unfollow and queue things. Basically where I put all the code I've created. 
STEPS: 
1. Import the code here : https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-8tqhe5bs/notebooks/binder/Index.ipynb# 
You may need to click file -> New Notebook -> Python 3. I'm not 100% sure. 
2. Go here: https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps 
Register an application and get the 4 keys. 
Once registered go here : https://api.tumblr.com/console/calls/user/info and get the keys. :) 
Should be that simple hopfully. 
Only need lines that look like this: 
consumer_key: 'KEY HERE',
  consumer_secret: 'KEY HERE',
  token: 'KEY HERE',
  token_secret: 'KEY HERE'
